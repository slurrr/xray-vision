# Planning Directory

This directory contains **planning artifacts only**.

- No implementation code lives here
- Each subdirectory represents an independently governed subsystem
- Each subsystem contains:
  - spec.md (authoritative behavior)
  - tasks.md (ordered implementation plan)

Specs may reference:
- ARCHITECTURE_NEXT_LAYERS.md
- Subsystem AGENTS.md

Implementation must follow specs exactly.
